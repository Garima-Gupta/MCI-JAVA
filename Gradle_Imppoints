To set repo authentication for gradle:

repositories {
    maven {
        credentials {
            username repoUser
            password repoPassword
        }
        url "http://nexus........."
    }
}

Settings.gradle file, located in the root project directory, tells Gradle which modules it should include when building your app.
It is mainly used to build multiple projects.A business application usually does not consist of only one single project/module, but has many projects, which should be build.

Gradle has the concept of a root project, which can have many sub projects. The root project is specified by a build.gradle file, like the single projects before. 
To specify, which projects belong to the build a settings.gradle file is used.

gradle init --type pom is used to convert pom to gradle build.
